**Mapping Sources**
Mappings are generated by different sources in two different ways: automatic mappings and user generated mappings.
Automatic mappings are generated by the portal from:
- LOOM. This algorithm automatically computes mapping based on close lexical match between preferred names of terms or a preferred name and a synonym. The lexical match is performed if white-spaces and punctuation are removed from the labels. All labels with less than 3 characters are excluded. These mappings are represented by the mapping relationship "skos:closeMatch".
- SameURI. Generated between two concepts with the same URI.
- CUI. Generated between two concepts that have the same CUI (Concept Unique
Identifier).
User-generated mappings are uploaded and stored within the portal as RESTBackupMapping, namely a mapping added by a user using the REST API (or the UI, which is calling the API to create it).
In addition to these two, skos:exactmatch mappings are extracted from the file and displayed in the results table. The Source is indicated as skos:exactmatch.
For more information on how the mappings are handled inside the triple store, please refer to this documentation.
