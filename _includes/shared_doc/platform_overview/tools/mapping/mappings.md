The Mappings tool enables the association of two or more terms in different semantic
artefacts, typically indicating a degree of similarity between them. The author of the
mapping defines its relation; in addition, although not required, it is usually recommended
for a mapping to be bi-directional.
To upload mappings, use the “Upload mappings” button. A valid file format example is
available. You can either select the file or drag and drop it into the box.
Mappings can be searched in two ways:
1. Browse mappings between classes in different semantic artefacts by selecting
the semantic artefact from the drop-down menu. The results table will show all the
semantic artefacts to which the selected resource is mapped with and the number
of existing mappings (minimum one) (Figure 23). Select a semantic artefact from
this table to browse the mappings between the two semantic artefacts.
2. Find mappings of a class/concept by simply typing its name into the search bar.
A drop-down menu will appear displaying the relevant concepts/classes and their
associated resources (see Figure 24). Select the desired class/concept to view a
table with the same information as shown here.

To access mappings programmatically please see our Mappings REST API documentation.
