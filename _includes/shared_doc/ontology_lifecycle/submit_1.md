LifeWatch ERIC is a member of [DataCite](https://datacite.org/) and it can provide a [Digital Object Identifier (DOI)](https://www.doi.org/) to {{page.atoms}} that do not have one. DOIs allow {{page.atoms}} to be cited in scientific publications or elsewhere in a reliable and sustainable way. {{ page.portal }} assigns a DOI only upon verification and validation of the {{page.atom}}. The DOI is connected to the metadata of the resource as well as to its digital location (e.g. the URL) where all the details about the resource are available.
For more detailed information about metadata properties, refer to the General Information of the Metadata schema table.
